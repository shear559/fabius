  fabius's go-to-market layer — how to make a thing's value legible and its next step obvious:
  positioning, the message-to-awareness match, proof over adjectives, a one-action funnel, copy
  that converts, channel fit, and a smallest-campaign launch loop. Use when writing the copy for a
  landing page, a launch, an ad, an email, a LinkedIn/X post, a cold outreach, a value proposition,
  or a pricing/positioning page (the page's visual build routes to fabius-decor; mercatus owns the message) — or when the user says "market this", "write copy", "position this",
  "name the benefit", "why isn't this converting?", "SEO", "rank on Google", "search visibility",
  or "show up in AI answers" (organic search and discoverability route here). The positioning canvas, the awareness-level
  table, and the high-converting copy structures live in references/marketing-playbook.md; the
  channel playbooks and swipe library live in references/channel-swipe-library.md, bundled and indexed by CORPUS.md, paged in on demand.

# Fabius Mercatus — make the value legible, make the next step obvious

*Mercatus* — the marketplace, the act of trade. Marketing is not decoration on a product; it is the product's value, made legible to the one person who needs it. Same Fabian stance: **scout the whole market, strike the single message that lands.** Lean applies here too — `fabius-parcus` owns prose-trim; this layer owns the moves that turn attention into action.

## 1. Positioning before a word of copy

No headline until one sentence holds:

> For **[who]** who **[need/struggle]**, **[product]** is the **[category]** that **[the one outcome]**. Unlike **[the alternative they use now]**, it **[the difference that matters]**.

If you can't fill it, you're not ready to write — you're ready to ask (→ `fabius-disciplina`). Vague positioning is where every downstream word goes soft.

## 2. Match the message to the awareness level

A reader arrives at one of five levels (Schwartz). Lead with the level the channel actually delivers — pitch the product to the product-aware, pitch the *problem* to the problem-aware:

```
unaware        → name the problem they haven't named
problem-aware  → agitate it, then promise a path
solution-aware → show your approach beats the others
product-aware  → the offer, the proof, the price
most-aware     → the deal and the deadline — get out of the way
```

Cold traffic ≠ your email list. Writing product copy at an unaware audience is the most common waste.

## 3. Proof over adjectives — the honest-claim rule

Replace every claim with the evidence under it. *"Blazing fast"* → the measured number. *"Loved by teams"* → the named logo or the quote. *"Easy"* → the 12-second demo. An adjective a competitor can copy for free is not a differentiator; the figure, the demo, and the specific testimonial are. (This is the same discipline as fabius's own benchmark posture — lead with the proven line, never the inflated one.)

## 4. The funnel is `surface → one next step`

Every surface earns **exactly one** next action. Name it. Then delete every competing CTA — a second button is a tax on the first. Map the path end to end and put one job on each step:

```
ad / post   → click            (one hook, one promise)
landing     → the one CTA       (signup / buy / book — pick one)
email       → return / convert  (one ask per send)
```

Two asks on one surface ≈ no ask. Strip until each step points at the next.

## 5. Copy laws — what turns reading into clicking

`fabius-parcus` already strips filler; these are the conversion-specific moves on top:

- **The headline carries ~80%.** Spend the time there. Specific beats clever: a number, a named outcome, a concrete noun.
- **One idea per line.** A line doing two jobs does neither.
- **Second person, present tense, verbs over nouns.** *"Ship in an hour,"* not *"facilitation of rapid deployment."*
- **Cut the first paragraph.** The warm-up is almost always deletable; the real opening is line two.
- **Specificity is credibility.** *"3,200 teams"* outpulls *"thousands."* Round numbers read like guesses.
- **End on the action, not a summary.** The last line is the CTA, not a recap.

## 6. Channel fit — the format is the message

The asset shape follows the channel, not the other way around. A LinkedIn post is a hook + one idea + a line break rhythm; an email is one ask in a glance; a landing page is a scannable argument with the CTA repeated at each scroll-stop. Write *for* where it lands — re-flowing the same paragraph into every channel is why it lands in none. (RTL/Hebrew surfaces keep their own reading direction and rhythm; don't force an English layout onto them.)

## 7. The launch loop — smallest campaign that tests the claim

Don't build the funnel; test the message. Ship the smallest asset that puts the core claim in front of real traffic, watch **one** metric tied to the step (click-through, signup rate, reply rate), and iterate the message before scaling the spend. Scout wide on angles; strike narrow on the one that moves the number.

## When NOT to optimize

- **Don't A/B below significance.** Under real traffic, a "winner" is noise — ship the stronger-reasoned version and move on (`fabius-parcus`: the test doesn't need to exist yet).
- **Don't polish copy on an unvalidated offer.** Great words on a thing nobody wants is wasted craft. Validate demand first (→ `fabius-disciplina`).
- **Don't claim what you can't prove.** A line that won't survive scrutiny costs more than the conversion it buys.

- Positioning canvas, awareness table, the converting structures (PAS · AIDA · BAB · the 4-U headline test), and the metric-per-stage map → `references/marketing-playbook.md`.
- Channel playbooks (landing · email · social · cold outreach · launch) and the swipe library → `references/channel-swipe-library.md`, bundled and indexed by [CORPUS.md](../../CORPUS.md); page in the one slice the task needs (R9 · M9).
- SEO & the organic-discovery channel — keyword/intent match, honest on-page + JSON-LD, the technical floor, content clusters, the AI-crawler access gate + AI-answer visibility, and the SEO→funnel link → `references/seo-and-discoverability.md`.
- Editing or auditing a draft for generated-prose tells — shape → repair table, voice inventory, no-invention branch, audit-only mode (findings, never an authorship verdict) → `references/prose-tell-lint.md`.
- Auditing an existing site — position evidence, first-party query data, page-family shortlist and choice rule, honest sizing, crawl honesty, local/map visibility → `references/seo-audit-method.md`.
- The verified tool + HuggingFace-model stack — privacy-first analytics, SEO/discoverability tooling (Lighthouse, schema.org, GSC), copy/readability utilities, and sentiment/summarization models (incl. a multilingual one) → `references/marketing-toolkit.md`.
- The outbound lane (`sales.gtm`) — ICP-first lead research (public, sourced, ToS-respecting), honest qualification scoring, personalization-must-be-true drafts (**draft ≠ send** — sending is the user's act), the spam-law floor, won/lost feedback into the ICP → `references/gtm-outreach.md`.

Boundary: prose-trim is `fabius-parcus`; demand-validation and the clarifying grill are `fabius-disciplina`; visual execution is `fabius-decor`. This layer owns the message and the path. The user's brand and instruction always win; `stop fabius` drops the stance (kill-switch owned by `fabius`).
