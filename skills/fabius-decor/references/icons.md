# Fabius Iconarium — the icon-system map

Loaded on demand by `fabius-decor`. An icon is a *token*, not a decoration — it inherits the same laws (one accent, tokens-not-inline, restraint, designed states). This file is the map: which icon system to adopt, how to bind it to the token contract, and the one law that outranks all of it — **one family, one stroke width, per surface.** Mixing a 2px line set with a 1.5px one, or a line set with a filled one, is the single most common amateur tell. Pick one; earn every exception.

*(Licenses verified 2026 — but re-check before shipping a sealed/redistributed build. `MIT`/`ISC`/`Apache-2.0`/`CC0` are clean; `CC BY` needs **attribution**; `custom`/`proprietary` need reading the terms.)*

## The icon laws

1. **One family per surface.** All UI chrome comes from a single set. A second family fragments the eye exactly like a second accent color. Brand logos and emoji are *separate layers* (below), not exceptions to this.
2. **One stroke width.** Line sets have a grammar — Lucide/Tabler are 2px, Heroicons/Iconoir ~1.5px. Never intermix grammars; bind the width to an `--icon-stroke` token so every glyph obeys.
3. **`currentColor`, never a baked hex.** Good sets render `currentColor`, so icons ride `ink`/`muted` for free and only the *active* one takes `primary`. That's the one-accent law expressed in SVG.
4. **Size on a token.** `--icon-sm 16` / `--icon-md 20` / `--icon-lg 24`, snapped to the spacing base. Optical-size sets (Carbon, Fluent, Material) are *drawn per size* — pick the drawing that matches the grid, don't scale a 16px glyph to 32.
5. **An icon is not a label.** Icon-only controls need `aria-label`; decorative icons need `aria-hidden="true"`; interactive ones need a designed `:focus-visible` ring. Meaning never rides shape or color alone (a11y + colorblind law).
6. **Static by default.** A plain SVG is motion-restraint for free. Animate only on interaction, never idle-loop (the one exception: an indeterminate loader — below).

## Pick the line system

Default to **Lucide**; reach past it only for a reason in the right column.

| System | License | Scale · grammar | Reach for it when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Lucide** *(default)* | ISC | 1600+ · 24px / **2px** line | Modern line UI. Best tree-shaking (`lucide-react`/vue/svelte), permissive, supersedes Feather. |
| **Tabler Icons** | MIT (SVGs) | ~5900 · 24px / **2px** | Same grammar as Lucide but 3–4× coverage — you rarely break one-family to find a glyph. |
| **Phosphor** | MIT | ~1250 × **6 weights** · 16px grid | One family must span fine chrome → heavy display, or you want duotone. *Lock one weight per surface.* |
| **Heroicons** | MIT | ~300 · **1.5px** outline + 3 solid sizes | Already in Tailwind; want outline(default)/solid(active) with sizes pre-optimized. |
| **Iconoir** | MIT | 1600+ · **1.5px** line + solid | A more delicate stroke than Lucide, fully free, no upsell. |
| **Radix Icons** | MIT | 318 · **15×15** pixel-fit | Dense dashboards where crispness at ~15px matters. Frozen set — supporting role only. |
| **Remix Icon** | Remix Icon License v1.0¹ | 3200+ · line **+ fill** twins, 24px | Guaranteed line/fill pair per icon = clean default/active toggles. ¹Bespoke (was Apache); free commercial, re-read. |
| **Material Symbols** | Apache-2.0 | ~3600 · variable font, 4 axes | Want ONE variable font whose **weight axis IS your stroke token** (fill/grade/optical-size too). Self-host for CSP. |
| **Carbon (IBM)** | Apache-2.0 | ~2000 · per optical size 16/20/24/32 | Enterprise/data-dense; icons drawn per size. *Note: `@carbon/icons` bundles IBM Telemetry — a supply-chain flag.* |
| **Fluent System Icons** | MIT | ~2000 · Regular/Filled × optical sizes | Microsoft-aligned; matched outline/filled per size, MIT. |
| **Octicons** | MIT | GitHub's set · 16 & 24 optical | Third enterprise-grade, size-optimized, MIT set (`@primer/octicons`). |
| **Hugeicons (free)** | MIT (free) / proprietary Pro | 4600+ · one style (Stroke Rounded) | Large contemporary rounded line set, free = single style (enforces one-family). *Solid/duotone are paid.* |
| **Bootstrap Icons** | MIT | 2000+ · **fill-based**, 16px | Bootstrap stacks. Fill grammar — don't sit it beside a 2px line set. |
| **Ionicons** | MIT | 1300 · outline/filled/**sharp** | Ionic/mobile web. *Default variant is FILLED — set it explicitly.* |
| **MingCute** | Apache-2.0 | 3000+ · outline **+ fill**, 24px/2px | Clean Apache alternative to Remix/Boxicons; matched pairs. |
| **Myna UI Icons** | MIT | 1180+ · 24px / **1.5px** | Genuinely-MIT delicate-stroke set (alt to Untitled UI). |
| **Solar** | CC BY 4.0² | 7401 · **7 styles** | Warm rounded aesthetic, rich style range, via Iconify. ²Attribution required; lock one style. |
| **Iconsax** | custom free³ | 1000 × 6 styles | Popular multi-style peer of Phosphor. ³Non-SPDX (no resale) — flag as free/custom. |
| **Font Awesome (free)** | icons CC BY 4.0 · font OFL · code MIT | ~2000 free · mostly Solid | Legacy/CMS, or its **Brands** glyphs. Attribution required; most outline icons are Pro. |
| **Boxicons** | icons **CC BY 4.0** · font OFL · code MIT⁴ | ~1600 · Regular/Solid/Logos | Budget outline+solid+logos. ⁴Attribution required — **not** MIT despite common belief. |
| **Untitled UI Icons** | custom free⁵ | 1100+ free · 2px line | Figma-first SaaS look. ⁵Non-SPDX "free, no attribution"; solid/duotone paid. |
| **Streamline** | proprietary freemium | 100k+ | Enormous coverage + matched illustrations, *if you have budget.* Not license-clean for an open artifact. |

**The meta-loader — Iconify** (`code: MIT`, each set keeps its own license · 250k+ icons / 200+ sets). Not a set: one API/component (`@iconify/react`, `iconify-icon` web component) that renders almost every open set on demand. Use it to *trial* families then **commit** to one — its power is also the temptation to mix. Two cautions: (1) verify the license of the *set you ship*, not Iconify's code; (2) default rendering fetches SVGs from Iconify's API at runtime — for CSP/offline/sealed builds, self-host or bundle the offline `@iconify-json/<set>`.

## Animated icons — state-driven, never idle

Animation on an icon must obey the restraint law: **triggered by interaction/state, finite, transform/opacity only, gated behind `prefers-reduced-motion` (render the static first frame).** No idle loops, no pulse. The one legitimate loop is an indeterminate **loader**.

| Resource | License | What · fit |
|---|---|---|
| **pqoqubbw/icons** (lucide-animated.com) | MIT | *Best restraint fit.* Copy-paste React components on Lucide + Motion — same 24px/2px grammar as your static Lucide, animates transform/opacity only, lives in your repo under your tokens. |
| **Lottie runtime** (`lottie-web`, `@lottiefiles/dotlottie-web`) | MIT (runtime) | The tokenized embed layer for any Lottie (incl. Lordicon exports). Play `autoplay={false} loop={false}` on mount/interaction. |
| **LottieFiles assets** | per-file⁶ | Marketplace of Lottie animations. ⁶License varies per file — "free" ≠ one license; verify each. |
| **Rive** | runtimes MIT · editor freemium | Truly *interactive* icons — the state machine maps 1:1 to rest/hover/active/disabled inputs; motion is state-driven and finite. Binary `.riv`, needs the editor. |
| **Lordicon** | proprietary (player OSS) | 45k+ animated icons, hover/click/morph triggers. *License bars using it AS your core icon pack — accent moments only, not a redistributed system.* |
| **useAnimations** | CC BY (attribution) | ~40 clean toggle line icons (React). *Must attribute; can't redistribute the raw files.* |
| **SVGator** | proprietary SaaS | *Author* bespoke animated SVG/Lottie — enforce the laws at design time, export clean, self-host. Free tier watermarks. |
| **SVG Spinners** (n3r4zzurr0) | MIT | The token-clean **loaders**: pure-SVG spinners (`svg-spinners:` via Iconify), `currentColor`, no JS. The one allowed loop — a real progress indicator, still reduced-motion-gated. |

## Brand & logo marks — a separate layer

Company/tech logos are not your icon family and not governed only by a file license — **the marks are trademarks** (CC0/MIT covers the *drawing*, never the right to imply endorsement). Keep them on a dedicated "brand wall" surface; never let a colored logo leak into a monochrome UI-icon row.

- **Simple Icons** (`CC0-1.0`) — 3400+ *monochrome* single-path brand SVGs; `cdn.simpleicons.org/{slug}/{color}` so the tint is a token. The default logo layer for socials/integrations. Read `DISCLAIMER.md` (trademarks).
- **SVGL** (code `MIT`, logos per-brand) — full-*color* logos with light/dark variants + a public API. Treat as images (`--logo-h`), don't recolor.
- **gilbarbara/logos** (`CC0` drawings, via Iconify `logos:`) — full-color dev/tech logos through the same Iconify pipeline as your icons.
- **Devicon** (`MIT`) — language/framework/tool logos with plain(monochrome) *and* colored variants — pick plain for token-clean UI, colored for a stack wall.
- **Font Awesome Brands** (icons `CC BY 4.0`) — ~490 social/brand glyphs with a *font* path Simple Icons lacks; attribution required.
- **theSVG** (`thesvg.org` · `github.com/glincker/thesvg`) — code `MIT`; ~4,600 brand marks **plus the AWS Architecture pack (739 icons) redistributed unmodified under `CC BY-ND 2.0`**. The live index is the **`.org`** — `thesvg.com` is a parked for-sale listing now, so never cite it. The license split bites per *file*, not per repo: a no-derivatives icon may not be recolored, re-stroked or bound to `currentColor` at all, so it structurally cannot obey law 3 — keep the AWS set on the brand wall exactly as shipped and never let it into a tokenized UI-icon row.

**When the mark is missing.** The trademark line above decides it: a real company's mark exists on a surface only as a file — the product's own, supplied by the user, or a third party's from the licensed layer above. With no such file, the brand name is set in the system's own type in the mark's slot and the gap goes into the hand-off caveats. Recollection, a lookalike text face or a UI-icon glyph never stands in for the mark, and the identity on the surface stays the one the user supplied. Existing marks only: a brand that has none yet may have one authored, and a supplied raster may be vectorized ([`design-assets.md`](design-assets.md), Vectorize row). Icons keep laws 1–2 above: the project's own set first, then one linked family of the same stroke grammar, the swap named in the caveats; [`design-critique.md`](design-critique.md) §4 already refuses emoji or hand-drawn glyphs as icons.

## Emoji & flags

One emoji set project-wide (they're a family too). Emoji are decorative accents — never carry meaning without a text label.

- **Fluent Emoji** (`MIT`) — *cleanest for a tokenized system*: Flat + High-Contrast styles slot into light/dark + a11y; no attribution. Default to Flat (skip 3D/animated — reads as AI-slop).
- **Noto Emoji** (font `OFL 1.1` · images `Apache-2.0`) — Unicode-complete; the **monochrome** variant inherits `currentColor` like an icon; color as a webfont.
- **OpenMoji** (`CC BY-SA 4.0`) — coherent house style, on-brand-able "black" outline variant; *share-alike is copyleft* — heavier to redistribute.
- **Twemoji** (jdecked fork; code `MIT`, graphics `CC BY 4.0`) — consistent cross-platform flat emoji tracking current Unicode; attribution required; use the jdecked fork (Twitter's is archived).

**Flags** — *a flag is not a language* (never flag "English"); pair with a text label, one aspect ratio per surface, designed focus on the control.

- **flag-icons** (lipis, `MIT`) — country flags + CSS classes keyed by ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 (`.fi-us`). The default.
- **circle-flags** (HatScripts, `MIT`) — 400+ *circular* SVG flags (incl. language/subdivision) — round locale chips/avatars.
- **country-flag-icons** (`MIT`, GitLab source) — tree-shakeable SVG + React + Unicode fallbacks; the de-facto layer under phone-number selects.
- **Flagpack** (`MIT`) — flags as typed React/Vue/Svelte components with a hairline border (a small contrast win on light surfaces).

## Token integration

```css
:root{
  --icon-sm:16px; --icon-md:20px; --icon-lg:24px;   /* size on a token */
  --icon-stroke:2;                                   /* one stroke width */
  --icon:var(--muted);                               /* default tone; active → var(--primary) */
}
.icon{ width:var(--icon-md); height:var(--icon-md); color:var(--icon); }
[data-active] .icon{ color:var(--primary); }         /* only the active glyph earns the accent */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce){ .icon-anim{ animation:none !important; } }
```

- Lucide/Tabler/Iconoir/Feather: pass `strokeWidth={var(--icon-stroke)}` (Lucide: `absoluteStrokeWidth` to stop scaling).
- Material Symbols: one `font-variation-settings` line sets weight(=stroke)/fill/optical-size for every icon.
- Icon-only button: `<button aria-label="Close">` + a `:focus-visible` ring; the SVG is `aria-hidden`.

## Pairs with

`fabius-decor` (the laws), **Fabius Motus** (the motion engines behind animated/Rive/Lottie icons), **Fabius Bidi** (which directional icons mirror in RTL — chevrons/arrows/send flip, clocks/checks/logos don't), **Fabius Materia** (illustrations/3D/fonts), and `fabius-parcus` (one family, `currentColor`, static-by-default is also the *smallest* icon layer).

Informed by **system_prompts_leaks** (asgeirtj, CC0-1.0 compilation; the collected vendor prompts remain their vendors' text) — studied for the missing-mark fallback and the reported icon substitution, re-expressed in fabius's own voice; no prompt text carried, nothing bundled.
