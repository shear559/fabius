description: >
  Maintain and retrieve permissioned project memory in the workspace's declared record store.
  Read a named project's record before work; preserve decisions, provenance, indexes, and history.
  Use for cross-session continuation, recording verified lessons, knowledge-base maintenance,
  legacy memory migration, meeting or video source ingest, and source-grounded notebook questions.
  One canonical store, gated writes, and fresh evidence before recalled conclusions on incident
  routes. Provider changes do not require moving records when the store is already shared.
when_to_use: >
  "what did we decide last time", "save this for later", "set up project memory", "index the
  vault", before work on a project that already has a record, "watch this video", "what does this recording show", "ask my sources", or before
  redoing research a past session covered, "migrate memory", "consolidate legacy notes".

# Fabius Archivum — don't re-derive what you already learned

*Archivum* — the record office, where what's settled is kept. This layer makes knowledge compound: write it down, link it, retrieve it, keep it true.

## Three layers

- **Raw sources** — the immutable source-of-truth documents. Read them, never edit them.
- **The wiki** — an agent-owned directory of markdown pages (entities, concepts, comparisons, syntheses). This is the externalized long-term memory — the part that compounds.
- **The schema** — a concrete config encoding the directory structure, the conventions, and the workflows. It turns a chat assistant into a disciplined archivist.

Two navigation files keep hundreds of pages tractable:

- **Index** — a catalog: every page with its link, a one-line summary, and metadata. Read this FIRST at query time, before opening any page.
- **Log** — append-only, consistently prefixed, chronological. Greppable and tailable with plain unix tools.

## The three operations

**Write boundary.** Archivum never turns a read-only task into a mutation. Ingest, capture, file-back, scaffold, and lint writes run only when the workspace has opted into Archivum memory **and** its contract authorizes those writes. Otherwise return a proposed record or diff without touching the store.

**Ingest (WRITE).** A new source arrives → read it under `fabius-disciplina` → write a summary page → update the index and touched cross-references → append one log line. Mutate surgically; prove claims. A video is a source too — captions first, frames only as the question demands, every claim quoted at `t=MM:SS`, never "I watched" → `references/video-ingest.md`.

**Query (READ).** Narrow through the index and symbolic filters → read the matching slice → synthesize a **cited** answer. File it back only under the write boundary above.

**Lint (MAINTAIN).** Periodically self-heal: contradictions, stale claims, orphan pages, missing cross-references, data gaps. Post-mortems and architecture write-ups become new pages.

## Page hygiene

- One page = one entity, concept, or decision. Link liberally with `[[other-page]]` — a link to a not-yet-written page is a valid forward marker, not an error.
- Frontmatter for retrievability: a stable id/name, a one-line description (this is what the index shows), a type, and **absolute** dates (`2026-06-21`, never "last week"). A project page adds status, a repo/workspace pointer, a live URL — read, never guessed — and a last-push date.
- Don't duplicate — update or supersede the existing page. Preserve decision history: tombstone/archive a wrong record and link its replacement; delete only an unambiguous current-run duplicate when the authorized scope and recovery path make that safe. Don't transcribe the source verbatim; record what was non-obvious.

## When to add vector retrieval

Index + grep handles a few hundred pages — the lazy default (`fabius-parcus`: *does the vector store need to exist yet?*). Add a dense index only once the corpus outgrows symbolic search, or queries turn semantic rather than keyword. Then retrieval is **hybrid**: narrow symbolically first, dense-rerank only that slice. Detail → `references/memory-schema.md`.

## The loop that compounds

```
ingest (write) → index (catalog/embed) → query (read, cite, file back) → lint (maintain) → ↺
```

Inside the write boundary, the agent handles summarizing, cross-referencing, filing, and consistency checks. Schema and line formats → `references/memory-schema.md`. For ranked local excerpts, use original `scripts/retrieval.mjs`: explicit files, BM25, cited lines, and content-based stale rejection; no packages or model calls. Usage and limits → `references/local-retrieval.md`; larger retrieval choices → `references/retrieval-stack.md`. Meeting capture → `references/meeting-capture.md`.

## Cross-session memory — the project record

The next session starts where the last ended, but only inside a workspace that opted into a **record store**. The store is *declared*, not discovered from the repo: it may sit outside every repo and serve many projects, one page per project. Full contract → [`references/project-records.md`](references/project-records.md).

Legacy consolidation or a store-schema change → [memory-migration.md](references/memory-migration.md): preserve sources, account for every import, respect link boundaries, and verify retrieval in a fresh context. A provider switch with a shared store needs no copy.

- **Resolve the store before testing for one.** A central hub (one page per project, shared index + log) or an in-project store — never both. Already opted in → the offer is spent: read every time, never re-ask, never scaffold a second store beside a declared one.
- **Project-page gate — a precondition, not a dial.** Work that names a project reads that project's ONE page IN FULL first: brief · stack · decisions · health · open items · live URL. Not the index row, not a grep hit. No page for a named project in a declared store → propose the page; don't start blind.
- **Cross-check the page against reality, not against itself.** An unversioned page's dates are a claim. Diff them against the tree's head and any live URL it names. Reality wins on facts, the page wins on intent; correct the page in the same session.
- **One record, one owner.** Project state lives on the canonical page only; a harness store keeps cross-project behavior, never a copy. A fact in two stores eventually disagrees with itself.
- **Sync is finishing, not follow-up.** Before reporting done, same session: dated decision lines, state fields bumped, open items rewritten to the next step, one appended log line.
- **Assume a second writer.** Append at the END, append-only; read the tail, never rewrite a shared log; sign every entry and decision line. Never re-date or edit another writer's entry.

What goes in: the things the *code doesn't say* — decisions and their why, rejected approaches, gotchas, live URLs, current goals, open threads. One page = one thing, linked with `[[slug]]`.

### Onboarding (offer once)

Plain markdown, best browsed in Obsidian (backlinks · graph · Dataview). Offer the choice once — Obsidian, or plain md with `index.md` + grep — then never re-ask. Steps, the store-root trap and the index exclusions → `references/project-records.md`. Never block work for setup; never scaffold without authorization.

## Auto-recall — surface memory without being asked

Auto-recall is a dial, not a universal prepend. **Off** for trivial work; **off or dampened** for security, incident, debugging, and error-recovery fresh-eyes routes; index-only for ordinary continuation; deeper only when the task truly matches. The dial governs prior *conclusions*, never a named project's own page — that read is a precondition, not a dial position. On fresh-eyes routes, inspect current evidence first and compare memory afterward. Every retrieved record is a suspect candidate: verify that its situation matches and its outcome was proven before using it; prefer the newest verified value when records conflict.

When recall is enabled, keep its three stages separate:

- **Capture** — in an authorized opted-in store, record a durable decision/fix/result without blocking the work.
- **Compress** — turn the raw capture into a small, *typed and titled* record (a title + a type + a compact body), not a transcript dump. Typed-and-titled is what makes later filtering and progressive disclosure cheap.
- **Re-inject** — when the recall dial permits, surface a compact index of matching recent records; do not dump it blindly into every task.

Retrieve under **progressive disclosure**: when recall is on, inject titles/ids first and pull a full record only on demand. Check the harness before wiring anything: its native memory is the trigger/pointer tier, not a second record store — records land in the declared store and the harness index keeps the pointer. Hand-wire only where the harness ships nothing (`references/external-recall.md`).

## Ground in an external corpus — ask, don't guess

When an answer must be **source-true** (a spec, a contract, a curated body of documents), route the question to an authoritative external corpus that answers **only** from its sources and signals uncertainty — never pattern-match from weights. Keep a source registry (`{ name, description, topics }`) and select by topic; to register an unknown corpus, ask it to summarize *itself* first. After each answer, diff it against the *original* request and re-query the gaps — synthesize only when nothing is missing. Stay provider-agnostic; keep credentials and the registry **out of the repo**. Connector recipe + the when-to-reach-external table → `references/external-recall.md`; the source-grounded notebook instance → `references/notebook-connector.md`.

## Memory discipline — page, don't stuff

The memory rules from the routing policy (MemGPT, Voyager, the memory surveys; full set in [routing-policy.md](../fabius/references/routing-policy.md)):

- **Retrieve on demand (R9).** Read the index, then the matched page fully when exact evidence requires it; never load an unrelated whole page or directory "just in case" — the page of the project in hand is not a candidate hit, it is the brief, and it is read whole. If the matched set exceeds budget, summarize-then-link. *(MemGPT)*
- **Write only decision-changing facts (M7).** Authorized `write = EVICT` (durable fact → page + log); `read = RECALL` (index→page on a miss, logged as QUERY). Everything addressable by `[[slug]]`.
- **Promote verified solutions to skills (M6).** When skill writes are authorized, file a solved-and-verified sub-problem as a named reusable page; supersede, don't duplicate, and retain failed approaches as anti-pattern history. *(Voyager)*
- **Tie-break by recency + load-bearingness (M8).** When index entries tie on relevance, surface the freshest decision-bearing pages first; fold a grown batch of log lines up into a synthesis page. *(Generative Agents, analogy)*

**Live tier (optional).** Index + log + grep needs nothing; auto-recall rides the harness's own memory as a trigger tier where it has one, lifecycle hooks where it doesn't. Where memory must be a *tool*, the Messages API ships a GA one (`memory_20250818`) whose handler you own — and must path-validate. fabius bundles the *pattern*, not the service — full map in [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../ARCHITECTURE.md) (*External connections*).

Pairs with: `fabius-disciplina` (resolved facts and post-mortems get filed here), `fabius-cohors` (grounding and cross-session memory for agents), `fabius-parcus` (don't build the heavy retrieval engine before the corpus demands it).
