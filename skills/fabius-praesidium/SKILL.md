  fabius's defensive-security layer — how to find and fix what an attacker would exploit, before
  they do: threat-model first (STRIDE per trust boundary), run the OWASP pass, enforce secrets and
  least-privilege hygiene, review secure-by-default, check the supply chain, and ship every finding
  with a severity, a fix, and a regression test. Use when building or reviewing anything that
  touches auth, user input, secrets, payments, file upload, external requests, or dependencies — or
  when the user says "is this secure?", "threat-model this", "audit this", "harden this", "review
  for vulnerabilities", or "security review". Defensive only — it hardens, never weaponizes.
when_to_use: >
  "can this be hacked", "check the dependencies", "we leaked a key", "lock this down", reviewing
  an AI-generated diff or a third-party skill/plugin before adoption, a face-swap / lip-sync /
  voice clone of a real person.

# Fabius Praesidium — find it and fix it before someone finds it for you

*Praesidium* — the garrison, the protecting force. This layer is the standing guard on the work: it scouts the whole attack surface and strikes the specific holes. **Scope is strictly defensive** — praesidium threat-models, audits, hardens, and fixes. It does **not** write exploits, malware, intrusion tooling, or anything whose purpose is to attack a system it doesn't own. `fabius-parcus` owns the *never-trim* security floor (don't cut validation/security); this layer owns the *active* work of modelling the threat and proving the hole is closed.

## 1. Threat-model before you secure (STRIDE)

You can't harden a surface you haven't mapped. Before touching code, name the pieces:

- **Assets** — what's worth stealing or breaking (data, money, identity, availability).
- **Trust boundaries** — every edge where data crosses a privilege line (client→server, service→service, user→admin, untrusted→trusted).
- **Adversary** — who, with what access, wants which asset.

Then walk **STRIDE** per boundary: **S**poofing · **T**ampering · **R**epudiation · **I**nfo-disclosure · **D**enial-of-service · **E**levation-of-privilege. Each box is a question: *can they?* The unanswered boxes are your work list.

## 2. The OWASP pass — audit, don't assume

Run the concrete checklist over the top risks. Each is a thing to *verify present*, not hope for:

- **Injection** — every query parameterized; no string-built SQL/shell/LDAP; no `eval` on input.
- **Broken access control** — authorize *every* request server-side (an authenticated user is not an authorized one); deny by default; no IDOR (object IDs checked against the caller).
- **Broken authentication** — sessions rotate, expire, and invalidate; no credentials in URLs; rate-limit the login.
- **SSRF / unsafe fetch** — allowlist outbound targets; never fetch a user-supplied URL raw.
- **Secrets exposure** — none in code, logs, history, or client bundles (§3).
- **Insecure deserialization / unsafe parsing** — don't deserialize untrusted data into live objects.
- **Vulnerable dependencies** — audited and pinned (§5).
- **Security misconfiguration** — defaults changed, debug off in prod, headers set (CSP, HSTS), errors don't leak stack traces.
- **XSS / output handling** — encode on output, context-aware; sanitize rich input.
- **Logging & monitoring gaps** — security events are logged (without logging the secrets themselves).

## 3. Secrets & least privilege

- **No secret in the artifact** — not in source, not in a log line, not in a committed `.env`, not in client-side code. A secret in git history is a leaked secret; rotate it.
- **A manager, not a constant** — env + a secrets manager; reference, never inline.
- **Scope every token to the minimum** — a read job gets a read token; a service gets only the permissions it uses. Default-deny, then add. (Same least-privilege contract as `fabius-cohors` for agents.)

## 4. Secure-by-default review

The review checklist that catches the common holes:

- **Validate at the trust boundary** — the specific check `fabius-parcus`'s never-trim list demands; praesidium names *what* to validate (type, range, length, format, allowlist).
- **Authenticate, then authorize** — two separate gates. Fail **closed**: on error or ambiguity, deny.
- **Parameterize and encode** — input parameterized into queries, output encoded for its sink.
- **Least surface** — disable what you don't use; close the port, drop the endpoint, remove the flag.

## 5. Supply chain

Pin dependencies with a lockfile; audit them (`npm audit` / `pip-audit` / `cargo audit`) and act on highs; verify provenance for anything you didn't write; and **minimize vendor count** — every dependency and every external service is attack surface and trust you've delegated. Fewer, audited, pinned (this is the same minimize-dependencies principle the rest of fabius runs on).

## 6. The fix contract — a finding isn't closed until it's proven closed

Every finding ships as a triple, never a vague warning:

```
[severity: critical/high/medium/low]  the concrete vulnerability + where
→ fix:    the specific remediation (the change, not "be careful")
→ proof:  a regression test / check that fails before the fix and passes after
```

Severity sets order: critical/high first, and a critical at a trust boundary stops the ship. (Prove-before-done is `fabius-disciplina`; praesidium gives it the security-specific evidence.)

## 7. The AI review pass — review the diff, flag only what's exploitable

When the job is to **review a change** (a diff, a PR) rather than design a system, run an AI security pass — but the value is entirely in the *discipline that suppresses noise*, not in flagging everything:

- **Stance:** a senior security engineer doing a *focused* review for **high-confidence, actually-exploitable** issues. Set the bar in the instructions, not after the fact.
- **Confidence gate.** Report a finding only when you're confident it's *truly exploitable* (≈0.8+). A clear, named exploit pattern qualifies; "suspicious / conditional" does **not** — drop it. *Better to miss a theoretical issue than to flood the report and get ignored.*
- **Every finding carries an exploit path.** If you can't write a plausible `exploit_scenario`, it isn't a finding — that field self-enforces the gate.
- **A do-not-report list, not a vibe.** Hardcode the low-signal classes you'll suppress unless impact is proven: generic DoS / rate-limiting / resource-exhaustion, open redirects, input-validation with no shown impact, secrets merely stored on disk, theoretical races, memory-safety outside languages that can express it. These are *tunable per project*, not universally safe to ignore — say so.
- **Two-stage filter (order matters for cost).** A cheap deterministic pre-filter (drop excluded classes, docs-only files) first; only then spend tokens on per-finding LLM adjudication.
- **Scope narrow, read wide.** Analyze only the changed lines, but explore the surrounding repo for context — and flag where the new code *deviates* from the security pattern the codebase already uses.

**Hard caveat:** an AI reviewer is **not** hardened against prompt injection. Run it only on **trusted** diffs; an untrusted external contribution can carry instructions in the diff itself. Gate external-PR review on maintainer approval. (Confidence threshold and model are point-in-time tuning, not laws — keep them configurable. Full method in `references/ai-review.md`.)

## When NOT to over-secure

- **The threat-model sets the bar, not paranoia.** Don't add crypto, controls, or ceremony a real adversary model doesn't justify (`fabius-parcus`: does this control need to exist?) — but **never** drop below the never-trim floor to save effort.
- **Don't roll your own crypto/auth.** Reach for the vetted library or platform primitive (parcus ladder); hand-rolled security is a vulnerability with extra steps.
- **Don't bury the real risk in a hundred lint nits.** Report the load-bearing findings first; note the cosmetic ones, don't drown the signal.

## References

- STRIDE-per-boundary template (including the boundaries of a personal agent that reads your accounts and acts outward), the OWASP checklist as a runnable list, the secrets-hygiene checklist, and the severity→fix→proof format → `references/security-playbook.md`.
- Hardening guides and the audit library → `references/hardening-guides.md`, bundled and indexed by [CORPUS.md](../../CORPUS.md); page in the one slice the task needs (R9 · M9). Defensive only — guides to harden and detect, never to attack.
- The AI diff/PR review pass — the confidence gate, the do-not-report exclusion list, the two-stage filter, and the prompt-injection caveat → `references/ai-review.md`.
- The supply-chain leg — auditing third-party AI artifacts (skills, plugins, agents, MCP servers) and CI before you adopt them: the exec/data/net/creds/terms gate (a hosted service you connect an account to included), SHA-pinning against the auto-update blind window, sandboxing, least-privilege creds, and repeatable Semgrep / Action-pinning rule packs, and the likeness/voice consent gate → `references/supply-chain-and-ai-artifacts.md`.
- The **external view** — auditing the surface a host already publishes to any client: mail authentication (SPF/DMARC/DKIM — the most-missed high finding, and it applies to non-sending domains too), TLS chain + expiry, security headers graded PER CSP DIRECTIVE (`'unsafe-inline'` in `style-src` is ordinary; in `script-src` it is the attack — one flat-string grep reports the first as the second), cookie flags, plain-HTTP redirect, CAA/DNSSEC, `security.txt`, and what `robots.txt` advertises. Passive only; the one active port check needs explicit authorization. Demote findings the reader cannot act on (a platform subdomain's DNS is not theirs) — precision beats coverage, because a false positive costs future attention. Also the honesty bar for reviewing a private transport → `references/external-recon.md`. Runnable, keyless: `fabius recon <domain>` in `runtime/`.
- The security **toolkit** — the strongest actively-maintained open-source instrument for each defensive job (SAST · SCA · secrets · IaC · DAST · AI/LLM-model security), a pick-by-job index, and — behind an explicit authorization gate — the authorized red-team agents → `references/security-toolkit.md`. Reach for the vetted tool, don't hand-roll (parcus ladder).

Boundary: defensive only — never offensive tooling against a system the user doesn't own. (Authorized red-team of *your own* stack — a signed engagement or bug-bounty scope — is legitimate defense; the offensive AI agents are listed in `references/security-toolkit.md` behind an explicit authorization gate, and every finding still returns as severity→fix→proof.) The never-trim security floor is `fabius-parcus`; the test discipline is `fabius-disciplina`; agent least-privilege is `fabius-cohors`. This layer owns the threat model and the audit — with one carve-out: the pre-deploy audit gate for smart contracts and on-chain programs (Slither / Echidna / Foundry invariants) is `fabius-catena`'s; praesidium owns every other audit surface. The user's instruction wins on everything except cutting a guardrail; `stop fabius` drops the stance (kill-switch owned by `fabius`).
