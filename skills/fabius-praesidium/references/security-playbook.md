# Fabius Praesidium — security playbook

The operational depth for `fabius-praesidium`. The skill is the contract (threat-model → audit → harden → prove); this file is how you actually run each step — full templates, every variant, worked examples. The **deep** hardening + audit library (HTTP headers, auth patterns, per-type validation cookbook, output-encoding by sink, supply-chain commands, per-stack quick-harden) lives in the companion [hardening-guides.md](hardening-guides.md), indexed by [CORPUS.md](../../../CORPUS.md) and paged in **one slice at a time** (routing-policy R9 · M9). **Defensive only — harden / detect / audit / test. Scout wide, strike narrow.**

## 1. STRIDE per trust boundary — the template

You can't harden a surface you haven't mapped. First name the three things, then walk STRIDE per boundary. Each cell is a question — *can they?* An empty cell is an **un-checked** threat, not a safe one.

**Scope it first (fill before the grid):**
```
Assets:           <data · money · identity · availability — what's worth stealing/breaking>
Trust boundaries: <every edge data crosses a privilege line: client→server, svc→svc, user→admin, untrusted→trusted>
Adversary:        <who · what access they start with · which asset they want>
```

**The grid** — one row per boundary, one mitigation note per threat:

| Boundary | Spoofing | Tampering | Repudiation | Info-disclosure | DoS | Elevation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| client → server | | | | | | |
| service → service | | | | | | |
| user → admin | | | | | | |
| untrusted file/input → parser | | | | | | |
| owner command channel (phone / chat identity) → agent | a spoofed principal — allow-list, acting opt-in → cohors [local-agent-runtime.md §9](../../fabius-cohors/references/local-agent-runtime.md) | | | | | |
| connected account (mail / calendar / chat) → agent | | injection through the content it carries → [guides §9](hardening-guides.md) triage, then structure | | a derived plaintext mirror that outlives the grant → [guides §2](hardening-guides.md) grant lifecycle | | |
| agent → outward action (send / pay / book) | | | an unjournaled send → cohors [agent-patterns.md](../../fabius-cohors/references/agent-patterns.md) confirmation classes | | | a code read from the inbox completes the agent's own second factor → cohors [agent-patterns.md](../../fabius-cohors/references/agent-patterns.md) hand-off class |
| agent → acting machine (persistent host) | | | | | | cached credentials on the host → [guides §9](hardening-guides.md) proxy-held secrets |
| user → vendor contract | | | | data licence · agency clause → [supply-chain §3 step 5](supply-chain-and-ai-artifacts.md) | | |

**The last five rows are agent rows.** Fill them only when the system reads a person's accounts and acts in their name, and only after [guides §9](hardening-guides.md)'s delete-a-leg triage has run — a mailbox agent cannot delete the untrusted-content leg, which is why the rows exist. A plain API keeps the first four. The pre-filled cells are pointers, not mitigations; each still ends in ✅/❌.

**Worked example row (filled — copy this depth):**

| Boundary | Spoofing | Tampering | Repudiation | Info-disclosure | DoS | Elevation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| client → server (`POST /api/transfer`) | session cookie `HttpOnly`+`Secure`+`SameSite`; no auth-via-header-only ✅ | amount/recipient signed server-side, never trusted from body ✅ | audit log w/ user-id + request-id, append-only ✅ | error returns generic; no balance leak on 403 ✅ | rate-limit per-account 5/min; body-size cap ✅ | recipient + amount re-authorized against caller's own account — **no IDOR** ✅ |

Each filled cell ends in *mitigation present?* → ✅ yes / ❌ no / N-A. The **❌** rows are the work list, ranked by §5 severity. STRIDE letters: **S**poofing · **T**ampering · **R**epudiation · **I**nfo-disclosure · **D**enial-of-service · **E**levation-of-privilege.

## 2. The OWASP pass — runnable checklist (each item says HOW to verify)

**First settle *which* pass — it's set by what the target IS, not by what it's written in.** There are three, and a surface can need more than one:

- **A web / API surface** → the runnable checklist below.
- **A surface where a model reads text it didn't author** → add the **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications** (GenAI Security Project, 2026 edition, published 2026-08-04): LLM01 Prompt Injection · LLM02 Sensitive Information Disclosure · LLM03 Excessive Agency · LLM04 Supply Chain · LLM05 Data & Model Poisoning · LLM06 Unbounded Consumption · LLM07 Misinformation · LLM08 Hidden Context Exposure (formerly System Prompt Leakage) · LLM09 Vector & Embedding Weaknesses · LLM10 Improper Output Handling.
- **A surface where the model *acts*** — holds tools, carries memory across sessions, sets downstream consequences running — adds the **OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications** (published 2025-12-09): ASI01 Agent Goal Hijack · ASI02 Tool Misuse · ASI03 Identity & Privilege Abuse · ASI04 Agentic Supply Chain Vulnerabilities · ASI05 Unexpected Code Execution · ASI06 Memory & Context Poisoning · ASI07 Insecure Inter-Agent Communication · ASI08 Cascading Failures · ASI09 Human-Agent Trust Exploitation · ASI10 Rogue Agents.

**The line that scopes the audit: a model that *answers* is an LLM risk; a model that *acts* is an agent risk.** The two lists share a language rather than replacing each other — an agent that also reads untrusted text needs both passes. **Auditing an agent with only the web checklist audits the wrong system.** Category ids and ordering are point-in-time; re-check the current edition before quoting an id.

Run this over the top risks. Each line is a thing to **verify present**, with the concrete check — not a name to nod at. Tick only after you've looked.

```
[ ] injection           HOW: grep for string-built SQL/shell/LDAP and eval()/exec() on input;
                             confirm every query uses parameterized bindings / prepared statements.
                             → encoding-by-sink + parameterization recipes: hardening-guides.md §5
[ ] access control      HOW: pick 3 object-by-id endpoints; call each as a DIFFERENT user's id —
                             must 403, not 200 (IDOR test). Confirm authZ is server-side on EVERY
                             route, deny-by-default, not just hidden in the UI. → guides §2
[ ] authentication      HOW: log in twice — session id must rotate on login + on privilege change;
                             confirm logout/expiry invalidates server-side; no creds/tokens in URLs
                             or logs; login is rate-limited + lockout/backoff; a revoked
                             connected-source grant purges its derived copies (read-after-revoke). → guides §2
[ ] ssrf / unsafe fetch HOW: trace every outbound request built from user input; confirm an
                             allowlist of hosts/schemes and that link-local/metadata IPs
                             (169.254.169.254, 127.0.0.0/8, ::1, RFC-1918) are blocked. → guides §7
[ ] secrets             HOW: run the §3 secrets audit — git history + built bundle + logs.
                             Any hit = leaked = rotate. → guides §6
[ ] deserialization     HOW: confirm no untrusted bytes hit a native deserializer (pickle, Java
                             readObject, PHP unserialize, YAML unsafe_load); use data-only parsers
                             (JSON.parse, yaml.safe_load) + schema-validate after. → guides §3
[ ] dependencies        HOW: run the per-ecosystem audit (npm audit / pip-audit / cargo audit),
                             confirm a committed lockfile, triage highs/criticals. → guides §6
[ ] misconfiguration    HOW: confirm debug/stack-traces OFF in prod; security headers present
                             (CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy —
                             curl -I the prod URL); defaults changed; dir-listing off. → guides §1
[ ] xss / output        HOW: inject a probe string (e.g. "><svg onload=...) into each rendered
                             field IN A TEST; confirm it lands inert (encoded for its sink), not
                             executed. Context-aware encoding per sink. → guides §5
[ ] logging/monitoring  HOW: confirm auth failures, authZ denials, and input-validation rejects
                             are logged WITH request-id and WITHOUT the secret/PII payload itself.
[ ] file upload         HOW: confirm type sniffed from content not extension, size-capped, stored
                             off web-root with a generated name, never executed. → guides §3
```

The OWASP pass is the audit; STRIDE is what scoped the audit. Run STRIDE to find *which* boundaries matter, then run this list against each.

**Where the AI categories already have depth here — run them from the reference, don't re-derive.** ASI02/ASI05 and the egress boundary around an agent that runs code → [hardening-guides.md](hardening-guides.md) §9 (with the delete-a-leg triage that decides whether you need the containment at all). LLM01/LLM08 against a stateless chat transcript the client owns both sides of → §10. LLM04/ASI04 for third-party skills, plugins and MCP servers, including the spec's own normative MUSTs → [supply-chain-and-ai-artifacts.md](supply-chain-and-ai-artifacts.md) §2–4. Probing your own model for LLM01-class weakness → [security-toolkit.md](security-toolkit.md) §7. **The categories with no coverage yet are the work list** — and ASI06 is the sharp one wherever an agent carries persistent memory, because anything that can write into that store is an input to every later session.

---

## 3. Secrets & least-privilege hygiene — fast audit

```
[ ] grep history + built bundle + logs for keys/tokens/passwords  → ANY hit = leaked = rotate now
[ ] all secrets via env + a secrets manager, referenced never inlined  (no committed .env)
[ ] no secret reaches the client bundle (server-only env; check the shipped JS)
[ ] every token scoped to least privilege — a read job gets a read token, a service only what it calls
[ ] default-deny permissions/IAM, add only as a use proves the need  (same contract as `fabius-cohors` agents)
[ ] rotation path exists — a leaked secret can be revoked + reissued without a redeploy of trust
```

**The last hard boundary lives *below* the model — never in a prompt.** Once an agent can touch tools, a rule that says "don't exfiltrate" is *vibes-based egress control*: the model is not a control plane, and one bad outbound call undoes a hundred clever tool rules. Put the real boundary where the model can't argue past it — an outbound **allowlist** (hosts/schemes), network/DNS egress filtering, a filesystem sandbox, a scoped token that only reaches what the job calls. A denylist of "bad" commands is not that boundary: the shell is unbounded, so gate by **allowlist, deny-by-default**. Every capability handed to an agent — repo write, a shell, an external send — is a privilege grant priced at its **worst case, not its average** (`fabius-cohors` owns the same least-privilege rule at the agent-tool layer).

Concrete grep starting points (defensive scan of your *own* repo):
```bash
git log -p | grep -nEi '(api[_-]?key|secret|token|password|bearer|AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16})'
grep -rEi 'AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}|-----BEGIN [A-Z ]*PRIVATE KEY-----|sk-[A-Za-z0-9]{20,}' ./dist ./build 2>/dev/null
```
A secret in git history is a leaked secret even after you delete the file — rotate, then scrub history. Full env-vs-manager and IAM-scoping recipes: [hardening-guides.md](hardening-guides.md) §6.

## 4. Secure-by-default review checklist

The review pass that catches the common holes. Each is *verify present / prove closed*:

```
[ ] Validate at the trust boundary   — type · range · length · format · allowlist (the WHAT for
                                        parcus's never-trim "validate input"). → cookbook: guides §4
[ ] Authenticate, THEN authorize      — two separate gates; fail CLOSED (error/ambiguity = deny)
[ ] Parameterize and encode           — input parameterized into queries; output encoded for its sink
[ ] Least surface                     — disable unused: close the port, drop the endpoint, remove the flag
[ ] No secret in the artifact         — §3 holds
[ ] Safe-by-default config            — debug off, headers on, errors generic, dir-listing off  → guides §1
[ ] Idempotent + replay-safe          — state-changing requests carry a nonce/idempotency key where it matters
[ ] Rows nobody owns are public       — without identity there is no per-user access control: anyone who reaches
                                        the endpoint reads and rewrites every row. No personal or sensitive field
                                        lives there, and no single route wipes or rewrites the whole table; once
                                        accounts exist, the §2 access-control item and §6's worked finding apply
```

`fabius-parcus` owns the *never-trim* floor (don't cut validation/auth/security to save effort); praesidium names *what* to check and *proves* it closed. Don't add a control no adversary model justifies (parcus: *does it need to exist?*) — but never drop below the floor.

---

## 5. Severity rubric — what each level means

Severity sets order *and* the ship decision. Rate by **impact × reachability** (can a real adversary, from their starting access, actually reach it?).

| Severity | Meaning | Ship rule |
|---|---|---|
| **Critical** | Remote, unauthenticated path to full compromise / mass data loss / money movement — or any of those at an exposed trust boundary. RCE, auth bypass, secret leak in prod, IDOR exposing all records. | **Ship-stopper.** Block release; escalate; do not auto-merge. Fix before anything else. |
| **High** | Real compromise but gated — needs auth, a specific role, a non-default config, or user interaction. Stored XSS, privilege escalation within a tenant, SSRF to internal services. | Fix before this release ships externally; no new feature stacks on top until closed. |
| **Medium** | Limited blast radius or hard preconditions — info-disclosure of non-sensitive data, missing hardening header, weak rate-limit, verbose errors. | Schedule + track; fix this cycle; don't let it rot into a chain. |
| **Low** | Defense-in-depth gap, no direct exploit path — missing belt-and-braces header, minor config drift, cosmetic. | Note it; batch-fix; never let it drown the real findings. |

**Ship-stopper rule:** a **critical** anywhere, OR a **high** at a trust boundary that crosses a privilege line, blocks the ship. Everything else is scheduled, not blocking. When uncertain between two levels, rate up and say why — under-rating a reachable hole is the expensive mistake.

**Severity is the last call** — set after the weakness is proven and the candidate has survived §7. The rate-up tie-break above covers one doubt only: how far a *proven* weakness reaches. Where the higher level rests on steps nobody demonstrated, rate what was demonstrated. Starting access the adversary must already hold is written into **Risk** and counts against the level; a limit moves the level with its reason (disciplina's *narrowed*) and the finding stays in the report; not knowing a route's exposure belongs in the confidence figure, never in the level.

---

## 6. The finding format — severity → fix → proof

A finding isn't closed until it's **proven** closed. Every issue ships as the triple, never a vague "be careful". Order findings by severity; the load-bearing ones first (don't bury the critical under lint nits).

```
## [SEVERITY] <vulnerability> @ <file:line / endpoint / boundary>
- Risk:   <what an attacker gains, from what starting access>
- Fix:    <the specific change — code/config diff, not advice>
- Proof:  <a regression check that FAILS before the fix and PASSES after>
```

**Worked example finding:**

```
## [CRITICAL] IDOR on GET /api/orders/:id @ routes/orders.js:42
- Risk:   Any authenticated user fetches ANY order by guessing/iterating ids —
          full PII + payment-meta disclosure across all tenants. Reachable with a
          normal logged-in account, no special role.
- Fix:    Scope the query to the caller: load the order WHERE id = :id
          AND owner_id = req.user.id; return 404 (not 403) on miss to avoid an
          existence oracle. routes/orders.js:42.
- Proof:  Regression test — as user A, request user B's order id; assert 404.
          Fails on old code (returns 200 + body), passes after the owner-scope.
          A malicious INPUT (B's id) inside a defensive test is fine; it proves
          the hole closed, it is not an exploit.
```

The proof is the line that separates praesidium from a checklist. Prove-before-done is `fabius-disciplina`'s discipline; praesidium supplies the security-specific evidence — a test that encodes the bad input and asserts it now lands inert / denied.

**An applyable patch is a stronger claim than a finding — gate it.** In order, stop at the first failure, mark each gate `executed` or `reasoned`:

1. **The property** — before the edit, write the rule the code must keep: who may do what, to which object.
2. **The broken link** — say which link of input → control → sink no longer holds. "A check was added" names no link.
3. **Attack your own patch cold** — set the fix's rationale aside and look for what it skipped: other callers, equivalent sinks, a second class of input.
4. **The legitimate path still works** — run it on the patched build. Always `executed`: a feature broken by hardening is rolled back by whoever owns it, and the weakness ships again.

**A patch clears only if** its control sits ahead of the effect, holds without anyone opting in, fails closed and lowers no neighboring control. Cannot clear a gate → withhold the patch, remedy in prose, name the gate. Clean application, untouched neighbors and repo checks → `fabius-disciplina` ([codebase-and-proof.md](../../fabius-disciplina/references/codebase-and-proof.md)).

---

## 7. Fabius Quaestor — closure, and the cleared-surface record

An audit pass ships a second artifact beside §6's findings: a row for every surface opened × risk class, each carrying one of five states. A candidate nobody finished is **unresolved**, not closed; **no row = unexamined, never clean.**

| State | Valid only with |
|---|---|
| **proven** | a §6 finding |
| **disproved** | a specific candidate AND a named control — where it lives, observed on THIS path, ahead of the effect, failing closed |
| **unresolved** | the missing evidence, named — also any candidate under [ai-review.md](ai-review.md)'s reporting threshold. Never reached a state to observe it → disciplina's **BLOCKED** |
| **not applicable** | one line on why the risk class cannot exist here — held to disciplina's **SKIP** strictness, but a closed row: it does not make the record `incomplete` |
| **examined — nothing arose** | a note of what was looked at — cohors's stub contract ([agent-patterns.md](../../fabius-cohors/references/agent-patterns.md)) |

**Anything less leaves the candidate unresolved** — a guard seen elsewhere, a guard that may not run or runs too late, a gap in what you could learn. Limited exposure moves the level (§5), never the row. Through disciplina's verifier ([engineering-workflows.md](../../fabius-disciplina/references/engineering-workflows.md)): proven = its *confirmed*, disproved = its *discarded* held to this stricter bar; the last two states exist only in this record.

**Paired check** (authorized target only): a refusal counts as evidence only if the same route, at the same time, serves a normal request — otherwise you have measured an outage.

**Two accounts, kept apart.** The reviewer's account is labelled separately from what the harness observed (who ran, how they ended, what they were equipped for). Harness facts only *contradict*, never confirm: equipped for a risk class with no row → not examined (a heuristic match; say so). A run cut short, or any unresolved / BLOCKED row, marks the record `incomplete` — disciplina's ledger word (codebase-and-proof.md, linked in §6) — and never upgrades a claim.

## 8. Routing — when to page the deep library

| You're doing… | Page in (one slice) |
|---|---|
| Setting / verifying HTTP security headers | [hardening-guides.md](hardening-guides.md) §1 |
| Auth, session, password storage, MFA design | §2 |
| Hardening file upload / deserialization / parsers | §3 |
| Per-type input validation (string/number/email/url/id/file) | §4 |
| Output encoding by sink (HTML/attr/JS/URL/SQL) | §5 |
| Dependency + supply-chain audit (npm/pip/cargo) | §6 |
| Secrets + cloud IAM least-privilege | §6–7 |
| Quick-hardening a Node/Python/static/Worker stack | §8 |
| Threat-modelling or containing an agent — one that runs code, or one that reads a person's accounts and acts outward | §9 (delete-a-leg triage first), then the agent rows in §1 above |
| Securing a stateless LLM chat route where the client resends the transcript | §10 |
| A public route that spends the owner's money upstream (paid API, model call) | §11 |
| Closing an audit — what disproves a candidate, and the record of what was cleared | §7 above (this file) |
| Transferring a real person's face, voice or motion | [supply-chain-and-ai-artifacts.md](supply-chain-and-ai-artifacts.md) §8 |

Query the index for the **one** guide the task needs and page it; never load the library wholesale (`fabius-parcus`; routing-policy R9 · M9). Everything stays defensive — guides to *harden and detect*, never to attack. The never-trim floor is `fabius-parcus`; the test discipline is `fabius-disciplina`; agent least-privilege is `fabius-cohors`.

Informed by **system_prompts_leaks** (asgeirtj, CC0-1.0 compilation; the collected vendor prompts remain their vendors' text) — studied for the unowned-rows corollary of a store without accounts and the trust edges of an agent acting on a person's accounts; and **strix** (usestrix, Apache-2.0) — studied for settling severity after reachability, the gates on an applyable security patch, what may count as disproving a candidate, and a record of examined surfaces kept apart from harness observations; re-expressed in fabius's own voice; no prompt text carried, nothing bundled. See credits/README.md.
