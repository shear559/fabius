# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use **[private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/shear559/fabius/security/advisories/new)** — Security → Report a vulnerability. It opens a channel visible only to you and the maintainer, so nothing is disclosed while a fix is being made.

Please do not open a public issue for a security problem.

A first response should arrive within 72 hours. If a report is accepted, a fix and an advisory are published together; if it is declined, you get the reasoning rather than silence.

## What is in scope

fabius is a set of skill contracts, a plugin manifest and a zero-dependency local runner (`runtime/`) that hands the same sealed rules to a model through the user's own API key. The interesting surface is:

- **The runtime's gates.** Canonical-path confinement, secret-path refusal, environment scrubbing, exact-origin egress grants, `--dangerously-approve-everything`, and the ask posture. A path that reaches a secret, an unapproved network origin, or an irreversible command without the required authority is a real finding.
- **Secret redaction.** `redact()` is meant to cover every secret the runtime holds, the nostr identity key included. A secret that reaches a log or an artifact is in scope.
- **Untrusted-content separation.** Tool, repository, web, retrieval, and memory output is data, never authority. A payload that can turn embedded text into a higher-priority instruction, permission, origin grant, or new task is in scope even when the capability gate later refuses the action.
- **The provenance apparatus.** `provenance/verify.sh`, the seal manifest, the detached timestamp proof, and the signed tag. A way to swap a proof, mutate a released tree, or make `verify.sh` report a valid seal over content that was not sealed is the highest-severity class of bug in this repository.
- **Skill contracts that instruct an agent to take an unsafe action.** The skills are executable instructions; treat them as code.

## What is not in scope

- The behaviour of the underlying models. fabius is a rule set loaded above whatever model the user already runs — Claude, GPT, Gemini or any other; the model's outputs are not this project's attack surface.
- Anything requiring an already-compromised machine, since the runner holds the user's own API keys by design.
- The fact that a public repository can be cloned. [PROVENANCE.md](PROVENANCE.md) states this plainly: the design defends provenance and enforcement, not access.

## Original helpers and historical examples

The current local runner and capability helpers use Node built-ins without third-party package dependencies. Their actual boundaries are in scope: source/index validation and bounded reads in Archivum, caller authority and task/output validation in Cohors, generated-content escaping and output-path handling in Decor, and evidence consistency in Disciplina. These helpers are local processes; they do not provide an operating-system sandbox.

Version 3.0.0 removes the imported example projects and their dependency manifests. Historical releases still contain those files and their upstream licence notices. Dependency warnings for those older snapshots remain relevant if someone deliberately runs them; a successful old package install did not establish the security of an extracted example.

Dependabot proposes weekly updates for pinned GitHub Actions references. Its changes are reviewed rather than automatically merged. The current source scan and package gates must be rerun for each release; a removed manifest is not evidence that unrelated code is secure.

Release verification does not rely on an optional OpenTimestamps installation for detached-proof integrity. `scripts/verify-ots-binding.mjs` parses the bounded proof structure and binds its embedded SHA-256 to the exact sealed record using Node built-ins; the external OTS client is used only to classify and trusted-verify attestations. The historical signing tag object and key digest are pinned, every canonical tag must verify with that root, and an in-release or recent-tag signing-key replacement is rejected.

## Supported versions

The current sealed release, and that release only. Each release uses an Ed25519-signed `vX.Y.Z-sealed` tag and a content-bound OpenTimestamps proof. Bitcoin confirmation is asynchronous and may still be pending; `bash provenance/verify.sh` must report the actual state and must never treat “contains an attestation” as proof that the file or release matches.
