# The whitepaper

**[fabius-as-a-system.pdf](fabius-as-a-system.pdf)** — *Fabius — one set of operating rules across supported agent harnesses (v2.8.0).* The canonical, full whitepaper: the fifteen-skill architecture (the *praetorium* router that dispatches by layer + machinery + model-tier, four engineering specialists, nine domain verticals, on the always-on lean core), the proven core of **twenty-two** routing rules with a full **proof of the mathematics under every rule** — eighteen forming the mathematical core and four (R11–R13, M9) governing what the router itself adds — the coherence theorem (the core composes into one consistent, complete, composable decision system, with its exceptions printed in full), and one dated benchmark in four panels. Panel A improved three of four measured Claude tiers while shortening all four; Panel B's historical model-operated executed-code score records tied while its model-graded checklist scores rose; Panel C retains only aggregate cross-family demo scores; Panel D prints both gains and regressions. The score receipts do not retain the original answer text, Panel B artifacts, or Panel C raw run, so those historical results cannot be independently re-judged. The decision policy and coherence proof are stated over the routing core and hold unchanged as domain verticals are added on the same single-owner contract (`R1` Domain axis, `R13` verticals).

## How it was made — and why you can trust the math

The proofs were not hand-written and waved through. Each of the 26 formal statements was written by one agent and then **adversarially verified by an independent reviewer whose only job was to find an error**. That pass corrected ten of them — including a cap that should round to 4 not 3, a value-of-information attribution, a missing completeness hypothesis, and a linearity-vs-independence slip — before anything reached the page. A final auditor checked the whole set for cross-consistency and drafted the coherence capstone. The verified proof content lives in [`proofs.json`](proofs.json) and [`coherence.html`](coherence.html).

The honesty bar is the same as the rest of the project: measured, not claimed. Each proof block is classed **real-math** where the equation genuinely governs the routing decision, or **qualitative** where the statement is a control-flow invariant rather than a theorem — **22 real-math · 4 qualitative**, the class recorded per block in `proofs.json`. Every rule is fabius's own — derived and adversarially verified; the few operational heuristics are labelled as such, carry no proof claim, and never govern a route the way the mathematical gates do.

## Reproduce the PDF

```bash
bash paper/build.sh
```

This self-hosts MathJax, recomputes the figures (`numpy` → SVG), assembles the HTML, and renders the PDF with headless Chrome.

The figures and the benchmark's numbers are the same ones used in [`../RESEARCH.md`](../RESEARCH.md) and [`../BENCHMARKS.md`](../BENCHMARKS.md) — one benchmark, four panels, canonical receipt `../evals/results.benchmark.json`; the paper is their collected, proof-complete form.
